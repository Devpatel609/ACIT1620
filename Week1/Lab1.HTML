        <h1>HOW I START MY DAY</h1>
        <p> <h2><em>Wednesday and Thursday</h2></em>
            I wake up around 5:30am on Wednesdays and Thursdays as I have no early morning classes,
            I use that time to go to the gym and spend an hour there after coming back home I take my 
            dog out for a walk. Later that morning I attend a class of 3 hours, come back and 
            eat first of all to get energy in me and then start studying. I spend around 30 mins with
            my family throught out the whole day which is at night time, I go to sleep around 10pm.

            <h2><em>Monday, Tuesday and Friday</h2></em>
            On Monday, Tuesday and Friday I wake up around 6am as I have to attend classes early 
            morning, after attending the classes I take the sky train back home. It takes me an hour
            and half to commute and 3 hours for back and forth. After reaching home I eat, play with
            my dog and take a long bath. I start studying after 8pm on those days spend more time with
            my family than ususal as I get tired.
