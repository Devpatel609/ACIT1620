    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
        At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to 
        pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph?
        Is it a bulleted list? Is it a part of a table?), structure a document into logical
        sections (Does it have a header? Three colums of content? A navigation menu?), and embed
        content such as images and videos into a page.
        </p>
    
    <p>
        Elements consist of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A tag name</li>
        <li>Required or optional attributes</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="element.png"
    
    <p>
        It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted.
        In this HTML each nested element is intented by four spaces more than the one it is sitting 
        inside. It is up to you to choose the style of formatting (how many spaces for each level of indentation, for example).
    </p>

    <p>
        In Visual Studio Code, you can automatically format your code by following these steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
